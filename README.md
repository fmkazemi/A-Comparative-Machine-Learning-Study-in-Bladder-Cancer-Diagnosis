Abstract:
The aim of this research is to find the best model that can fit to Dataset 3 which is a data-set from bladder cancer patients that
contains their gender, smoke status and genotypic data.

At first we will try to limit features based on two methods: Generalized Low Rank Models(GLRM) and Gradient Boosted Feature Se-
lection (GBFS). Then, two methods of classification including Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) will
be applied to analyze purified data. Finally, two performance criteria including accuracy value and area under the ROC curve (AUC) are
used to evaluate output results.

The results showed that GLRM feature extraction method performed well by imputing missing values and producing low dimen-
sional features vector. On the other hand, GBFS feature selecting method could efficiently find the most important features that may
affect the patient cancer status.
